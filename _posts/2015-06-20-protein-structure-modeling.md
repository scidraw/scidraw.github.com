It's useful for protein structure modeling in biological research. Here, we summaried some online tools for protein 3D structure modeling.

<!--more-->

## Collect multiple homolog/mutate sequence

Only modeling one sequence is not meaningful, we always want to compare the structure of multiple sequence, so we need collect some sequence for comparision.

Some homolog sequences are best for 3D structure evaluation;

Some mutate sequences are best for mutation effect on the 3D structure;


## Multiple protein sequence alignment

The first step, we should investage the similarity among multiple sequences. T-coffee is a good software for this.

T-coffee also can be used to predict transmenbrane structure.

## Start 3D modeling

There are many protein structure (2D/3D) software, you can visit [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protein_structure_prediction_software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protein_structure_prediction_software).

### Start for this site

http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/?pid=modelling_interactive

The modelling interactive portal will tell you how to perform protein modeling by other software.
