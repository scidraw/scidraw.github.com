Some startup materials for cytoscape 3.0.

## Edges and nodes attribute values

Firstly, you should prepare a tab file store node attributes for every node in your network; Then, you should prepare a tab file store node attributes for each edges. The good example is:

Load a sample session file: From the main menu, select File â†’ Open, and select the file sampleData/galFiltered.cys.


## Layout settings

To make your network more informatics, you should choose the appropriate layout algorithm for your network. Before you start layout setting, you clearly know which attributes you will used to build the layout.

If you have no idea on it, you should first try "apply preferred layout".

On the other hand, you can choose algorithm to build you layout base on node, degree or network attributes.

Such as:

Degree sorted algorithm

Force-directed algorithm

Hierarchical clustering algorithm


## Annotation for network

GO and KEGG annotation.


## Network module detection

Many apps are work on it.
