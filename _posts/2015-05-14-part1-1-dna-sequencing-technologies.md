To summarize basic material for DNA sequencing, I collected videos for each technology. 

Start from sanger sequencing, we introduce the basic mechanism for DNA sequencing, then we give a brief view for next generattion technologies which is widely in clinical application. Finally, we introduce nanopore (a single molecule sequencing technology), which is the future direction of sequencing.

## Sanger sequencing

AB

## Next generation sequencing (SBS technology)

Next generation sequencing including illumina, iontorront, roche 454 sequencing. Illumina is the best one for short dna fragment sequencing. 


## Single molecular sequencing technology

Nanopore


## Library preparation
