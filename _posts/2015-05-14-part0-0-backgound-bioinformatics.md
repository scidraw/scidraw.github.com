Next generation sequencing have been widly used in biological research, bioinformatics is a field that how to deal with NGS data and give a reasonable interpretation to analysis result. Bioinformatics is new branch from computational biology that perform sequencs analysis in biology research. Bioinformatics is different from computational biology, because bioinformatics tend to focus on large amount of next generation sequencing data.

## Bioinformatics before NGS --- Computational biology

In the begining of 21 centry, there are only little sequence exists in the world. After the breakthrough in short fragment sequencing technology, a lot of genome sequence come out, bioinformatics/computer become very important in biological analysis. Before that, many computation biologist do a large amount of studies in sequence analysis, they try to explain sequence change match Darvin theries. You can learn more from [Durbin](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/genomeinformatics/#t_ref) in sanger, most of his early study focus on sequence family classification. But Durbin have been turn to NGS bioinformatic research, his student He Li and Ruan J. have developed the most popular short read alignment tool: BWA and MAQ. (The 2 guys are from BGI, China)
