Next generation sequencing have been widly used in biological research, bioinformatics is a field that how to deal with NGS data and give a reasonable interpretation to analysis result. Bioinformatics is new branch from computational biology that perform sequencs analysis in biology research. Bioinformatics is different from computational biology, because bioinformatics tend to focus on large amount of next generation sequencing data.
