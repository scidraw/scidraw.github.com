Tumor suppressor/driver mechanism study. Bioinformatics analysis can provide a lot of hypothsis, but only a few can lead to mechanism study.

<!--more-->

## Bioinformatics analysis

We can generate a lot of hypothsis by integrated large sample dataset, such as [TCGA](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), [ICGC](https://icgc.org/) and [CCGC](http://cancerdb.genomics.org.cn/).

How can we do more?

## Tumor suppressor/driver mechanism study

1. limit to drug to see clincal effect;

2. limit to cell line in moleular mechanism study;

3. combine these 2 is hard.

## What to do?

How can we do more in bioinformatics analysis?
