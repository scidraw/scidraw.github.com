This video is amazing, I want to collect it to my love. This video is useful for my class, I want to share it with my students. But youtube never provide a direct link for video download.

Firstly, copy link address of the video which you want to download;

Then, open [http://en.savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net) and paste the video link to the field before download botton.

Finally, click download botton, the website provide several link address for video with different resolution.

Click the file you need and enjoy yourself.
