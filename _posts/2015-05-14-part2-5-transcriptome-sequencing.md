The post will highlight some tips for transcriptome sequencing project. Every people have a different genome, Every tissue/cell in human body have dramatic pattern in different time. So it is difficut to draw the map/behavior of all gene element in our genome. To get a high quality profile RNA is the beginning to explor the biological world.

### Which kind of RNA-seq in suitable for your project?

For all trasncript studies, total RNA sequencing is suitable.

For protein coding gene studies, polyA RNA sequencing is suitable.

For transcriptome require strand information, strand-specific RNAseq in suitable.

### How much data do we need?

For protein coding message RNA quantification studies, 

For lncRNA and protein coding message RNA quantification studies,

For lncRNA and protein coding message RNA assembly and quantification,

For lncRNA and protein coding message RNA denovo assembly and quantification,


### Before transcript quantification, ref genome/transcript or assembly?



### RNA-seq data analysis protocols



### Differential expression gene detection (SNPs/Alterative Splicing/long noncoding RNA)

Fold Change

For all genes scored, the fold change was calculated by dividing the mutant value by the wild type value. If this number was less than one the (negative) reciprocal is listed (e.g. 0.75, or a drop of 25% from wild type is reported as either 1.3 fold down or -1.3 fold change). The reported fold changes are the average of the two independent experiments.

A change was deemed significant and reported in the lists containing genes > 2-fold down (or up) based on the following criteria: the gene was scored, the fold change was more than 2-fold in the two independent experiments, and the change in the values was above background values in both comparisons.
